- Yes,django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller.We can understand it through these code snippets:-

```
class Profile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    email = models.EmailField()

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def create_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):

    if created:
        # Simulate an error to trigger a rollback
        print("Creating profile for user...")
        raise Exception("Simulated error during profile creation")

```
```
def create_user_view(request):
    try:
        with transaction.atomic():  # Start a new database transaction
            user = User.objects.create(username='testuser8')
            return HttpResponse("User created!")
    except Exception as e:
        return HttpResponse(f"Error occurred: {str(e)}")
```
- Here we can see in the output:-
```
Error occurred: Simulated error during profile creation
```
- In the create_user_view, a transaction is started using transaction.atomic(). This means that all database operations within the with block are part of the same transaction.
- When the User is created, the signal is triggered, and the signal handler runs. If an exception occurs, the transaction is rolled back, and no changes are committed to the database.

This example demonstrates that Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller. Since the changes made in the signal handler (attempting to create a Profile) are rolled back due to the raised exception, it shows that the signal handler operates within the same transaction context as the User creation. If the transaction is rolled back for any reason, any changes made by the signal will also be rolled back, confirming that they are indeed part of the same transaction.
