- Yes ,Django signals by default run synchronously.We can see that in the code snippets

```
def create_user_view(request):
    User.objects.create(username='testuser2')
    return HttpResponse("User created!")

```
```
@receiver(pre_save, sender=User)
def pre_save_user(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    tme=datetime.datetime.now()
    print("Pre-save signal: Preparing to create user at...",tme)
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulating a delay
    print("Pre-save signal complete.")

```
```
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def post_save_user(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        print("Post-save signal: User created!")
        time.sleep(5)  # Simulating a delay

        print("Post-save signal processing complete at",datetime.datetime.now())
```

- In this code snippet,we can see the signal pre_save is called after the User is created.
- The pre_save function executes just before the user is being created
- On the other hand,in the slow_signal_handler function,we can see that the 
print statement is only executed after 5 seconds.We can see that in the output:- 

```
Pre-save signal: Preparing to create user at... 2024-09-26 20:32:38.804776
Pre-save signal complete.
Post-save signal: User created!
Post-save signal processing complete at 2024-09-26 20:32:48.815262

```
Here we can see the time difference that happens during the making of user.This shows that the django signal runs synchronously i.e. the instructions are executed sequentially.Had it been asynchronous,they both would have ran parallely at the same time and one wouldn't see a time difference for both the functions.
