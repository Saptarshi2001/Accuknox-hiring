- Yes,django signals run in the same thread as the caller.Suppose we take these code snipetts to create a user:-

```
@receiver(pre_save, sender=User)
def pre_save_user(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"View running in thread: {threading.get_ident()}")
    me=datetime.datetime.now()
    print("Pre-save signal: Preparing to create user...")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulating a delay
    print("Pre-save signal complete.")
```
```

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def slow_signal_handler(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        print(f"View running in thread: {threading.get_ident()}")
        print("Signal received. Delaying for 5 seconds...")
        time.sleep(5)  # Delay for 5 seconds to simulate slow processing
        print("Signal processing done.")
        print("User created at",datetime.datetime.now())
```
```

def create_user_view(request):
    print(f"View running in thread: {threading.get_ident()}")
    User.objects.create(username='testuser4')
    return HttpResponse("User created!")

```
Now if we look at the output:-
```
View running in thread: 23144
View running in thread: 23144
Pre-save signal: Preparing to create user...
Pre-save signal complete.
View running in thread: 23144
Signal received. Delaying for 5 seconds...
Signal processing done.
User created at 2024-09-26 19:10:26.588674
```
- Here we can see pre_signal being triggered before user is being created and post_signal being triggered after user is being created.Over here if we look at the thread id which is 23144,we see all the three functions having the same thread id which shows that all of them belong to the same thread.This shows that django signals run in the same thread as the caller.
